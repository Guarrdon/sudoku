/*
 * Writes dist/offline.json — the list of files this game needs to run with no
 * network, plus a hash of their contents.
 *
 * The portal's service worker reads it. It cannot work the list out for itself:
 * the filenames are fingerprinted at build time, and the worker lives in
 * another repository on another bucket. The build is the only thing that knows.
 *
 * The hash is what makes a deploy land. Assets are cached under a key built
 * from it, so new bytes mean a new cache and the old one is dropped; unchanged
 * bytes mean the worker recognises the build and does nothing.
